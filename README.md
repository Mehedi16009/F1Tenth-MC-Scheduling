# Physics-Informed Mixed-Criticality Scheduling for F1Tenth Cars

This repository contains a **Google Colab implementation** that replicates and extends the research paper:

> *Physics-Informed Mixed-Criticality Scheduling for F1Tenth Cars with Preemptable ROS 2 Executors (RTAS 2025)*

The project demonstrates how **real-time scheduling** directly impacts the **safety of cyber-physical systems** like autonomous cars.  
It is designed to showcase my ability to **understand, implement, and extend cutting-edge research** in **real-time systems and autonomous vehicles**.

## üöó Key Features
- **Preemptive EDF Scheduler** with **mode switching** (low vs high criticality).
- **Task set replication** (Driver, Health, Dummy tasks) based on RTAS 2025.
- **2D Vehicle Simulation** with simplified kinematics.
- **LiDAR-based hazard detection** to trigger physics-informed mode switching.
- **Monte Carlo Safety Analysis** comparing crash probability with vs without switching.
- **Visualizations** for publication-ready figures.

## üìä Results

### 1. Task Scheduling (Gantt Chart)
EDF schedules the Driver, Health, and Dummy tasks.  
With mode switching, the Driver period shrinks and Dummy1 is dropped ‚Üí faster reaction time.

### 2. Vehicle Trajectory
Car path on a 2D corridor.  
- Without switching ‚Üí delayed reaction ‚Üí higher crash chance.  
- With switching ‚Üí car adapts, stays safe.

### 3. Crash Probability (Monte Carlo Simulation)
Statistical safety evaluation.  
Mode switching significantly reduces crashes. (Numbers depend on simulation seeds.)

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run
1. Open the Colab Notebook.
2. Run all cells (runtime < 10 minutes for N=50, 10s per episode).
3. Generated figures are saved in the `figures/` folder.

---

## üîÆ Extensions
- Multi-core EDF scheduling.
- Comparison with fixed-priority scheduling.
- GPU-accelerated inference (PyTorch dummy model).
- Varying dummy task loads to stress-test schedulability.

---

## üéØ Why This Matters
This project illustrates the **core principle** of the RTAS 2025 paper:  
> *Bridging the gap between computational scheduling and physical safety in cyber-physical systems.*

By replicating and extending the results, I demonstrate ability in:
- Real-time systems  
- Embedded/autonomous systems  
- Safety-critical scheduling and verification
